### Total: ____ / 21

Each item is worth 1.5 marks, with advanced criteria an additional 0.5 marks.

- [ ] **0. Data Handling**  
  Properly loads and processes data from `responses.csv`  with Python
  *Advanced Criteria:* Efficiently handles large datasets or multiple files.

- [ ] **1. Algorithm Design**  
  Clear and logical algorithm design written in English before coding.
  *Advanced Criteria:* The algorithm is efficient and optimized for performance, avoiding unnecessary computations.

- [ ] **2. Use of Comparison Operators**  
  Effectively uses comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) to analyze data.  
  *Advanced Criteria:* Incorporates multiple comparisons in a single analysis.

- [ ] **3. Observations Made**  
  At least **2 interesting observations** are made based on the data analysis.  
  *Advanced Criteria:* Draws connections between observations and real-world implications.

- [ ] **4. User Interaction**  
  Implements user input to enhance interactivity and engagement with the program.  
  *Advanced Criteria:* Provides a user-friendly interface with clear prompts.

- [ ] **5. Code Quality**
