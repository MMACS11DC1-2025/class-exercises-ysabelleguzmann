# Mini-Project: Recursive Fractal Art Generator

## TOTAL ___ / 52

## Project Description

**Goal:** Create a Python program that generates beautiful fractal patterns using recursive functions in turtle graphics.
You will use recursion, function definitions, dictionaries, and turtle graphics to create visually impressive artistic patterns..!

### Requirements Summary
You'll create a fractal generator that can draw at least one recursive pattern (like a tree, snowflake, or spiral) with the following features:

1. **Recursive Functions**: At least one function that calls itself recursively
2. **Turtle Graphics**: Visual drawing using the turtle module
3. **Dictionary**: Store fractal settings in dictionaries (like the tree seasons in the drawTree example)
4. **Return Values**: Demonstrate understanding of the 'return' statement and recursion by being able to report the total number of recursive calls made
5. **User Interaction**: Include at least one user input to dynamically generate your graphics
6. **Documentation**: Complete a README.md file with testing and process explanation
7. **Peer Review**: Peer feedback to improve quality of work

## **SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Files to Include:**
1. **main.py** - Your complete Python program
2. **README.md** - Documentation file with all required content.
2. **PROJECT.md** - This file, self-graded with checklist.

### **Required Documentation Content Summary:**
- Project overview
- Explanation of your recursive approach and why it works
- How to run the program
- Screenshots of visual outputs (at least 2 different results)
- Test cases with expected vs actual results
- Discussion of reasonable recursion depth (why too low/high won't work)
- Discuss performance implications of different depths
- Suggest reasonable range for your implementation
- Testing, debugging, and validation process documentation
- Peer review discussion: feedback, code changes made (if any), and debugging support

### **Test Cases Required Summary:**
- At least 2 different test cases showing parameter variations
- Expected output description for each case
- Actual results from running the program
- Analysis of any differences between expected and actual

## **GETTING STARTED TIPS**

1. Start simple - begin with one fractal pattern before adding complexity
2. Test incrementally - check each recursive call works properly
3. Document your process as you go - this will help with the README
4. Think about edge cases - what happens when parameters are 0 or negative?
5. Don't forget to include peer review in your final submission
