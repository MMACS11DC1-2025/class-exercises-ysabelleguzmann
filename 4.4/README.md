**Explanation of program**
My project has three different options: SPIRAL, SNOWFLAKE, AND TREE
With user interactions, it will choose which one that they want to draw
and what colour(s) they want.


**Successes + Fails**
- trying to make a spiral but is stopping in one curve
- my curve and tree was going OUT of the space
- we used a goto 
- when asked how many levels, it writes more than what was asked for
- we finally put some colour into it making it look alive
- i cant seem to make the graphic fill the entire screen so i have to figure that out
- we also made a tree + a star(tweaked a little with the numbers)
-
