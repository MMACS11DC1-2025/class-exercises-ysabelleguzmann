# PROJECT 101

***MY PROGRAM***
In my project, there will be 10 images that the program that
will detect if either it is night time (dark colours like dark blue or black)
or day time (bright colours like light blue or white). The program should say that theyre is 5 of each time that represents
its requirements.


***struggles + what to finish***
- Mixed up the rgb values for day/night
- Percentages need to be created with how bright it is or dark it is
- must then use that information to create an assortment with brightest to darkest
- create a binary search with targeting which one is to be the darkest of them all
